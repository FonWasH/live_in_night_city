Modification to FonWasH's Live in Night City survival mode to include locations of apartments introduced in 1.5

* Added Z coordinate checking (otherwise you could rest on the couch in corpo plaza by walking towards the elvator on floor 0)
* Offset renamed to Slack and applied on both sides of the declared coordinate in Positions.lua
* substring search through position names (thanks DaniLt on nexusmods forums)
* partner rest locations and bar locations (thanks DaniLt on nexusmods forums)
